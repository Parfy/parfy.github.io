I"\<p>The project analyses a music track with python to extract features such as beats and pitch. The output from the analysis is then visualised live while the track plays. The idea is that a lot of the features of a music track that we recognise as humans can't be detected programmatically in realtime and instead need to be extracted offline.</p>
